I make things on the web, and help other people to make things.

I work full-time at Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia
leading a small team of web developers who make the
[VU website](//www.vu.edu.au/).

I work on other projects when I get time, usually with people I
like who are trying to make a positive difference in the world.

Recently I worked with [Kinart](//www.kinart.com.au) to create a
new home for [Artillery](//artillery.com.au/projects/graeae/),
an architecture and interior design firm in Melbourne, London and UAE.

I am on [Twitter](//twitter.com/j_cartledge) and
[LinkedIn](//au.linkedin.com/in/jcartledge) but I'm not very active
on either. You can see some of the codier things I've done at
  [GitHub](//github.com/jcartledge).

If you want to get in touch please email me at
[jcartledge@gmail.com](mailto:jcartledge@gmail.com).
