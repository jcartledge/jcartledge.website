I make things on the web, and help other people to make things.

I work full-time at Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia
leading a team of web professionals who make the
[VU website](//www.vu.edu.au/).

My career has taken me from solving problems with code to solving problems with people.

I am a Certified Scrum Master and a Certified Scrum Product Owner.

I am on [Twitter](//twitter.com/j_cartledge) and
[LinkedIn](//au.linkedin.com/in/jcartledge) but I'm not very active
on either. You can see some of the codier things I've done at
  [GitHub](//github.com/jcartledge).
